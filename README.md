- VPC
  - cidr ranges IPV4 can be expanded upto 5 address ranges
  - VPC can use IPV6 in dual-stack mode. your resources can communicate over IPv4, or IPv6, or both. IPv4 and IPv6 communication are independent of each other. 
  - You cannot disable IPv4 support for your VPC and subnets; this is the default IP addressing system for Amazon VPC and Amazon EC2.  
- avaliablity Zones:
  - Groupings of fault domains
- Subnets
  -  a segmented piece of a range of IP addresses in VPC
  -  To add a new subnet to your VPC, you must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the subnet from the range of your VPC.
  -  You can optionally specify an IPv6 CIDR block for your subnet if an IPv6 CIDR block is associated with your VPC. 
  -  You can specify the Availability Zone in which you want the subnet to reside. You can have multiple subnets in the same Availability Zone.
  -  Public subnet
    - The instances in the public subnet can send outbound traffic directly to the internet
  - Private subnet
    - The instances in the private subnet can't send outbound traffic directly to the internet. Instead, the instances in the private subnet can access the internet by using a network address translation (NAT) gateway that resides in the public subnet.
    - The instances can connect to the internet using the NAT gateway, but the internet cannot establish connections to the instances in private subnet.
