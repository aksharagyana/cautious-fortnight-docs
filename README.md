- VPC
  - cidr ranges IPV4 can be expanded upto 5 address ranges
  - VPC can use IPV6 in dual-stack mode. your resources can communicate over IPv4, or IPv6, or both. IPv4 and IPv6 communication are independent of each other. 
  - You cannot disable IPv4 support for your VPC and subnets; this is the default IP addressing system for Amazon VPC and Amazon EC2.  
- avaliablity Zones:
  - Groupings of fault domains
- Subnets
  -  a segmented piece of a range of IP addresses in VPC
  -  To add a new subnet to your VPC, you must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the subnet from the range of your VPC.
  -  You can optionally specify an IPv6 CIDR block for your subnet if an IPv6 CIDR block is associated with your VPC. 
  -  You can specify the Availability Zone in which you want the subnet to reside. You can have multiple subnets in the same Availability Zone.
  -  Public subnet
     - The instances in the public subnet can send outbound traffic directly to the internet.
  - Private subnet
    - The instances in the private subnet can't send outbound traffic directly to the internet. Instead, the instances in the private subnet can access the internet by using a network address translation (NAT) gateway that resides in the public subnet.
    - The instances can connect to the internet using the NAT gateway, but the internet cannot establish connections to the instances in private subnet.
    - The instances in the private subnet with IPV6 CIDR blocks can use an egress-only internet gateway to connect to the internet over IPv6, but the internet cannot establish connections to the private instances over IPv6.
  - Instances with private IPv4 addresses in all subnets (private and public) in a VPC can communicate with each other. 
- Internet Gateway
  - An internet gateway connects the VPC to the internet and to other AWS services.
- NAT Gateway
  - a NAT gateway is used so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your VPC but external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances.
  - You create a public NAT gateway in a public subnet and must associate an elastic IP address with the NAT gateway at creation. You cannot associate an elastic IP address with a private NAT gateway.
  - You route traffic from the NAT gateway to the internet gateway for the VPC.
  - Alternatively, you can use a (public or private) NAT gateway to connect to other VPCs or your on-premises network. In this case, you route traffic from the NAT gateway through a transit gateway or a virtual private gateway.
  - You can attach an internet gateway to a VPC with a private NAT gateway, **but if you route traffic from the private NAT gateway to the internet gateway, the internet gateway drops the traffic**.
